    metaPromptPrinciple4: "4.  **Constraints:** Specify what the AI should not do (e.g., \"Do not use external libraries,\" \"Do not apologize\").",
    metaPromptPrinciple5: "5.  **Output Format:** Define the exact structure of the output (e.g., \"Respond only in JSON format,\" \"Use H2 headings in Markdown\").",

    metaPromptImageInstruction: "**Image Analysis (CRITICAL):** If the user has uploaded one or more images, use this/these image(s) as the primary source of inspiration for the prompt. Deeply analyze the objects, atmosphere, style, color palette, layout, and composition in the images to enrich the prompt. The text input should be treated as additional context or a specific request related to the image(s). For example, if a website screenshot is provided, analyze its structure, components, and aesthetics.",
